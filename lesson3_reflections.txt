When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Keeping a remote repository allows you to access files from other computers and allows you to share your files with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Forks are a copy of someone elses file onto your repository.  It gives them credit.  Clones make a copy of a branch onto your local computer. Branches are diferent parts of a file.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
